### Hi, I'm Seohee ðŸ˜ƒ
- Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student in an interdisciplinary field where psychology, neuroscience, and computer science come together to uncover the mysteries of visual perception.
- My research focuses on mid-level processes in visual perception, like contours, shapes, curvature, and symmetry, aiming to bridge the gap between basic visual featuresâ€”like orientationâ€”and the higher-level semantic features that create meaning. I am also interested in exploring the intersection of human vision and AI, pushing the boundaries of cognitive neuroscience and helping to build AI systems that "see" more like humans.
- My colleagues and I developed analytical tools to capture how these features appear in real-world images. Check this page out!: https://github.com/bwlabToronto/MLV_toolbox
